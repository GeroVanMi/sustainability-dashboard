## Index Editor

You can search terms with “not: some term” to get exclusion. This is not a generic operator but works only for terms/keywords.

You can change a term by clicking on the term (and not the x) in the query list. This pulls up the term into the editor where you can change it and add it back to the query by hitting enter as usual.

You can pull in a matching term from the index list into the query editor by clicking in it. Btw. Sdg, term and lang filtering via the query apply to that list as well. There are a few perks that I find annoying with the editor and will fix them before the weekend. 

If you compose a query with a SDG, a language (using eg: “lang: de”), min. 1 and max. 2 positive terms and max. 1 “not”-term, then you can add the query as matching term by clicking on the diamond exclamation button (which will be green and tell you that you can add the query as index term).  That button is to the right of the eraser button.   

The cool thing about this editor is that you can see directly, which records a term matches. The indexer adds just a little more bells and whistles, by also considering the different spelling in us and uk English. These matches will be included for the actual matching but are not visible in the UI when creating the matching term.
